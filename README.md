Acknowledgments

This course was built on and expands material which we developed for a Carpentries course (CC-BY 4.0) with the support of the Centre for Data, Culture and Society.  It was adapted for hybrid teaching. We thank the Edinburgh Futures Institute and Prof. Laura Cram for supporting us in the long-term development of the EFI course as part of EFI's PGT training.
